# richset

A rich presence app which allows a user to set whatever they'd like on their profile based on the pypresence package.

## [Pypresence](https://github.com/qwertyquerty/pypresence)

# How to use

My code is decently documented. Read through and replace things with what you want instead. I have a few examples in the testing folder if you're lost or dont want to read the pypresence github

## The client_id.txt file

In order to protect myself from pushing my discord app token, I've created a file named client_id.txt which isn't pushed to github using a .gitignore. 

Create this file and place only your token in with no extra bits or bobs to get it working if you want to copy and paste and only change a few things. 

## The images

The discord dev portal allows you to upload images in the rich presence section, go there and upload your files, then use those names instead of the ones I have.
Change the links if you want it to be relevant to whatever you're putting on there.
